# Full Proposal

## Wekeza Open Banking Platform (Developer Ecosystem)

# 1. Executive Summary

The financial industry is rapidly shifting toward **platform-based banking**, where institutions expose secure APIs that allow fintechs, businesses, and digital platforms to integrate banking services directly into their products.

This platform will:

* Enable secure third-party access to customer-authorized financial data
* Allow external partners to initiate payments
* Support innovative ecosystems around Wekeza services
* Power internal products such as the **AI Financial Copilot (NextGen)**
* Create new revenue streams through API monetization

The initiative will transform Wekeza from a traditional bank into a **financial platform and innovation hub**, increasing global visibility and positioning the bank as a leader in digital banking innovation.
