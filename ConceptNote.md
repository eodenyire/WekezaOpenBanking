# Concept Note

## Wekeza Open Banking Platform

**Building a Developer Ecosystem for Next-Generation Financial Services**

---

## 1. Background

The financial services industry is rapidly shifting from traditional, closed banking models to **open, platform-based ecosystems**. Customers increasingly expect seamless financial services embedded within the applications and platforms they use daily. At the same time, fintech companies, merchants, and enterprises require secure and standardized access to banking capabilities.

Open Banking enables financial institutions to expose their services through secure APIs, allowing third-party providers to build innovative financial products. Globally, leading institutions and technology companies are adopting **Bank-as-a-Platform (BaaP)** and **Embedded Finance** models to drive innovation, partnerships, and new revenue streams.

To position Wekeza Bank as a modern, technology-driven institution, there is a need to establish a **comprehensive Open Banking Platform** that supports both internal innovation (such as the AI Financial Copilot) and external developer ecosystems.

## 2. Problem Statement

Currently, most banking capabilities are tightly coupled within internal systems, making it difficult to:

* Rapidly build new digital products
* Integrate with fintech partners and external platforms
* Reuse core banking capabilities across channels
* Enable real-time innovation
* Support embedded finance use cases

Without a standardized API ecosystem:

* Product development cycles remain slow
* Integration costs remain high
* Innovation opportunities with partners are limited
* The bank risks falling behind platform-driven competitors
